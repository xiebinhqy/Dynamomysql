#RTC Europe 2014 Data Sets

These are the data sets for my class "Utilizing Dynamo *Beyond* Computational Design" at [RTC Europe 2014](http://www.rtcevents.com/rtc2014eu/). You can find the original slides at [prezi.com](https://prezi.com/jqdljnvns9si/utilising-dynamo-beyond-computational-design/) - a PDF version of the slides as well as the 45 page handout should be available shortly on the [RTC website](http://www.rtcevents.com). Please note:

- You will need to install the latest version of package Clockwork for Dynamo in order to run most of these examples.
- All of these examples can be run on top of the basic sample architectural project that ships with Revit - unless indicated otherwise.
- Most of the examples require Dynamo 0.7.3 - unless the file name has the suffix "_063" which indicates that the example was created in Dynamo 0.6.3 and hasn't been migrated to Dynamo 0.7 yet. Follow me on [twitter](https://twitter.com/a_dieckmann) to be notified when that migration is complete - or simply watch this space...
