The sample files in the ```dynamo``` subfolder show how all of the custom nodes in package Clockwork work. They are organized by node category. In some cases you may need additional files (e.g. a Revit project file) for them to work - you can find those files in the ```extra``` folder.

#Please note:
I have just started migrating the documentation of all the nodes to 0.7.x so the contents of this folder are far from complete. The 0.6.3 documentation is more complete.
